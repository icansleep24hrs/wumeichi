                This is about the celebration of life --celebrating the different 
                aspects of facing death. I've been taught not to face what death is since 
                little, which caused my fear and denial of it. However, when I start to 
                understand the other side of death rather than simply refer it as end of a 
                body, that brings the meaning of various kinds for the relationship. We 
                are faced with the beginning and end of all kinds of relationships all 
                the time, but a seemingly ending relationship will leave others' lives 
                in us, extending its pain and spirit of life. Hope is born out of despair, 
                like death, like Pandora's box. So, do we all hover between the two, 
                constantly searching for the appropriate aspect to face this world?
