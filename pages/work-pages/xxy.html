                XXY, XYX, YXX are three series inspired by the mathematical coordinates 
                XYZ, although slightly modified to represent a distorted spatial reality. 
                The crucial first step of this work is a handmade installation combining 
                colorful objects, mirrors, fruits, and reflective paper. By playing with 
                angle, light, and the plastic characteristics of these objects, a “tricky” 
                image is created, one in which the viewer can try to recognize mundane 
                objects detached from their function and meaning. This fabricated world 
                then survives only in the frame of the photograph.
                <br>
                <br>These images represent my interest in destabilizing and remodeling 
                materiality through the camera. Everyday objects are interesting materials 
                because their ubiquity makes them malleable— an image of little value that 
                is easy to manipulate into something new. In this process, I rely on my 
                hands to conjure up an image, and the camera acts as a witness to it.
